# ceasar cipher is the simplest form of a cipher , 
#its not very secure,but as a basic i am giving a code which can help you to transform it,
#also i am giving how it works
#This cryptosystem is generally referred to as the Shift Cipher.
#The concept is to replace each alphabet by another alphabet which is â€˜shiftedâ€™ by some fixed number between 0 and 25.
#which is called the key.
#here is the code

            v=number-90
            number=64+v
        return number
    def greatera(num):
        #if the number exceeds 122 then it is called
